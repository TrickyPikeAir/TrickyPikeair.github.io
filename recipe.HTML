        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Gather all ingredients.
</p>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Line bottom and sides of a 13x9-inch baking pan with heavy duty aluminum foil, leaving a 2-inch overhang on all sides, lightly spray with baking spray; set aside.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Beat together white sugar, brown sugar, and butter with a stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes, stopping to scrape down sides as needed.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> With mixer running on low, add eggs, one at a time, beating until just combined after each addition. Beat in vanilla until just combined.
</p>

 <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Whisk together flour, baking powder, salt, and baking soda in a medium bowl until combined. With stand mixer running on low speed, gradually beat in flour mixture until almost fully incorporated, about 2 minutes, stopping to scrape down sides as needed.
</p>

<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Stir in chocolate chips and toasted walnuts until combined.
</p>

<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Transfer dough into prepared baking pan, spreading into an even layer.
</p>

<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Bake in preheated oven until golden brown and set, about 40 minutes, rotating baking pan front to back halfway through.
</p>


<p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Let cookie cool completely in pan on wire rack, about 1 hour. Using foil overhang as handles, lift cookie out of pan.
</p>

<p><strong>Step 10:</strong> Cut into 24 (about 2-inch) squares.

                    <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Place cottage cheese, maple syrup, oats, almond butter, vanilla, and salt into the cup of a high-speed blender. Blend until ingredients are smooth. Add almond flour to blender and blend until combined. Pulse if necessary to prevent warming the mixture.
</p>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Pour dough into a bowl and fold in chocolate chips. Serve immediately, or cover and keep stored in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.
